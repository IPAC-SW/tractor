Horribly incomplete, but online at http://thetractor.org/doc

## collaboration:

We are trying to move from a "Research code that only we use" phase to
"Research code that other people can use".  We are happy to hear your
feedback; please feel free to file Issues.  And naturally we will be
pleased to see pull requests!
