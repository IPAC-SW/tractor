   Weak weak lensing: correcting weak shear measurements accurately for

   We have developed a new technique for weak lensing analysis,
   specifically designed to correct accurately for the effect of the point
   spread function (PSF) on the shapes of small galaxy images. This method
   does not rely on weighted second moments of detected images, which we
   show can leave residuals at the level of a percent in the shear;
   rather, we directly fit observed galaxy images as PSF-convolved,
   sheared circular sources. We show by means of simulations that this
   technique is able to recover shears with systematic errors well below
   the percent level for representative PSF shapes, while its noise
   properties are similar to existing methods.

   The accurate measurement of galaxy ellipticities is vital for weak
   lensing studies, in particular cosmic shear. We describe a Bayesian
   approach to this problem in which galaxies are parameterized as sums of
   Gaussians, convolved with a PSF which is also a sum of Gaussians,
   following Kuijken (1999). We calculate the uncertainties in the output
   parameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We show that for
   a simple simulation, the ellipticity estimates do not give a biased
   result when averaged by statistical weight. It is shown that the
   uncertainties in the ellipticities are not increased by allowing
   freedom in the galaxy radial profile, or by allowing the photon shot
   noise level to be a free parameter. Finally we confirm the result of
   Kuijken (1999) that on changing the ellipticity of two point spread
   function Gaussian components, the reconstructed galaxy ellipticity is
   unbiased.

   The principles of measuring the shapes of galaxies by a model-fitting
   approach are discussed in the context of shape measurement for surveys
   of weak gravitational lensing. It is argued that such an approach
   should be optimal, allowing measurement with maximal signal-to-noise
   ratio, coupled with estimation of measurement errors. The distinction
   between likelihood-based and Bayesian methods is discussed. Systematic
   biases in the Bayesian method may be evaluated as part of the fitting
   process, and overall such an approach should yield unbiased shear
   estimation without requiring external calibration from simulations. The
   principal disadvantage of model fitting for large surveys is the
   computational time required, but here an algorithm is presented that
   enables large surveys to be analysed in feasible computation times. The
   method and algorithm is tested on simulated galaxies from the Shear
   TEsting Programme (STEP).

   A likelihood-based method for measuring weak gravitational lensing
   shear in deep galaxy surveys is described and applied to the
   Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS).
   CFHTLenS comprises 154 deg^2 of multi-colour optical data from the CFHT
   Legacy Survey, with lensing measurements being made in the i^' band to
   a depth i'[AB] < 24.7, for galaxies with signal-to-noise ratio nu[SN]
   >~ 10. The method is based on the lensfit algorithm described in
   earlier papers, but here we describe a full analysis pipeline that
   takes into account the properties of real surveys. The method creates
   pixel-based models of the varying point spread function (PSF) in
   individual image exposures. It fits PSF-convolved two-component (disc
   plus bulge) models to measure the ellipticity of each galaxy, with
   Bayesian marginalization over model nuisance parameters of galaxy
   position, size, brightness and bulge fraction. The method allows
   optimal joint measurement of multiple, dithered image exposures, taking
   into account imaging distortion and the alignment of the multiple
   measurements. We discuss the effects of noise bias on the likelihood
   distribution of galaxy ellipticity. Two sets of image simulations that
   mirror the observed properties of CFHTLenS have been created to
   establish the method's accuracy and to derive an empirical correction
   for the effects of noise bias.

   Means of confusion: how pixel noise affects shear estimates for weak
   gravitational lensing

   Weak-lensing shear estimates show a troublesome dependence on the
   apparent brightness of the galaxies used to measure the ellipticity: in
   several studies, the amplitude of the inferred shear falls sharply with
   decreasing source significance. This dependence limits the overall
   ability of upcoming large weak-lensing surveys to constrain
   cosmological parameters.

   We seek to provide a concise overview of the impact of pixel noise on
   weak-lensing measurements, covering the entire path from noisy images
   to shear estimates. We show that there are at least three distinct
   layers, where pixel noise not only obscures but also biases the outcome
   of the measurements: (1) the propagation of pixel noise to the
   non-linear observable ellipticity; (2) the response of the
   shape-measurement methods to limited amount of information extractable
   from noisy images and (3) the reaction of shear estimation statistics
   to the presence of noise and outliers in the measured ellipticities.

   We identify and discuss several fundamental problems and show that each
   of them is able to introduce biases in the range of a few tens to a few
   per cent for galaxies with typical significance levels. Furthermore,
   all of these biases do not only depend on the brightness of galaxies
   but also depend on their ellipticity, with more elliptical galaxies
   often being harder to measure correctly. We also discuss existing
   possibilities to mitigate and novel ideas to avoid the biases induced
   by pixel noise. We present a new shear estimator that shows a more
   robust performance for noisy ellipticity samples. Finally, we release
   the open-source PYTHON code to predict and efficiently sample from the
   noisy ellipticity distribution and the shear estimators used in this
   work at https://github.com/pmelchior/epsnoise.

   Gravitational lensing shear has the potential to be the most powerful
   tool for constraining the nature of dark energy. However, accurate
   measurement of galaxy shear is crucial and has been shown to be
   non-trivial by the Shear TEsting Programme. Here, we demonstrate a
   fundamental limit to the accuracy achievable by model-fitting
   techniques, if oversimplistic models are used. We show that even if
   galaxies have elliptical isophotes, model-fitting methods which assume
   elliptical isophotes can have significant biases if they use the wrong
   profile. We use noise-free simulations to show that on allowing
   sufficient flexibility in the profile the biases can be made
   negligible. This is no longer the case if elliptical isophote models
   are used to fit galaxies made up of a bulge plus a disc, if these two
   components have different ellipticities. The limiting accuracy is
   dependent on the galaxy shape, but we find the most significant biases
   (~1 per cent of the shear) for simple spiral-like galaxies. The
   implications for a given cosmic shear survey will depend on the actual
   distribution of galaxy morphologies in the Universe, taking into
   account the survey selection function and the point spread function.
   However, our results suggest that the impact on cosmic shear results
   from current and near future surveys may be negligible. Meanwhile,
   these results should encourage the development of existing approaches
   which are less sensitive to morphology, as well as methods which use
   priors on galaxy shapes learnt from deep surveys.

   Noise bias in weak lensing shape measurements

   Weak lensing experiments are a powerful probe into cosmology through
   their measurement of the mass distribution of the universe. A challenge
   for this technique is to control systematic errors that occur when
   measuring the shapes of distant galaxies. In this paper, we investigate
   noise bias, a systematic error that arises from second-order noise
   terms in the shape measurement process. We first derive analytical
   expressions for the bias of general maximum-likelihood estimators in
   the presence of additive noise. We then find analytical expressions for
   a simplified toy model in which galaxies are modelled and fitted with a
   Gaussian with its size as a single free parameter. Even for this very
   simple case we find a significant effect. We also extend our analysis
   to a more realistic six-parameter elliptical Gaussian model. We find
   that the noise bias is generically of the order of the inverse-squared
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the galaxies and is thus of the order of
   a percent for galaxies of SNR 10, i.e. comparable to the weak lensing
   shear signal. This is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the
   systematic requirements for future all-sky weak lensing surveys. We
   discuss possible ways to circumvent this effect, including a
   calibration method using simulations discussed in an associated paper.

   Weak gravitational lensing has the potential to constrain cosmological
   parameters to high precision. However, as shown by the Shear Testing
   Programmes and Gravitational lensing Accuracy Testing challenges,
   measuring galaxy shears is a non-trivial task: various methods
   introduce different systematic biases which have to be accounted for.
   We investigate how pixel noise on the image affects the bias on shear
   estimates from a maximum likelihood forward model-fitting approach
   using a sum of co-elliptical Sérsic profiles, in complement to the
   theoretical approach of an associated paper. We evaluate the bias using
   a simple but realistic galaxy model and find that the effects of noise
   alone can cause biases of the order of 1-10 per cent on measured
   shears, which is significant for current and future lensing surveys. We
   evaluate a simulation-based calibration method to create a bias model
   as a function of galaxy properties and observing conditions. This model
   is then used to correct the simulated measurements. We demonstrate
   that, for the simple case in which the correct range of galaxy models
   is used in the fit, the calibration method can reduce noise bias to the
   level required for estimating cosmic shear in upcoming lensing surveys.

   We present and describe IM3SHAPE, a new publicly available galaxy shape
   measurement code for weak gravitational lensing shear. IM3SHAPE
   performs a maximum likelihood fit of a bulge-plus-disc galaxy model to
   noisy images, incorporating an applied point spread function. We detail
   challenges faced and choices made in its design and implementation, and
   then discuss various limitations that affect this and other maximum
   likelihood methods. We assess the bias arising from fitting an
   incorrect galaxy model using simple noise-free images and find that it
   should not be a concern for current cosmic shear surveys. We test
   IM3SHAPE on the Gravitational Lensing Accuracy Testing 2008 (GREAT08)
   challenge image simulations, and meet the requirements for upcoming
   cosmic shear surveys in the case that the simulations are encompassed
   by the fitted model, using a simple correction for image noise bias.
   For the fiducial branch of GREAT08 we obtain a negligible additive
   shear bias and sub-two per cent level multiplicative bias, which is
   suitable for analysis of current surveys. We fall short of the sub-per
   cent level requirement for upcoming surveys, which we attribute to a
   combination of noise bias and the mismatch between our galaxy model and
   the model used in the GREAT08 simulations. We meet the requirements for
   current surveys across all branches of GREAT08, except those with small
   or high noise galaxies, which we would cut from our analysis. Using the
   GREAT08 metric we we obtain a score of Q = 717 for the usable branches,
   relative to the goal of Q = 1000 for future experiments. The code is
   freely available from https://bitbucket.org/joezuntz/im3shape

   Cosmic shear is a powerful probe of cosmological parameters, but its
   potential can be fully utilised only if galaxy shapes are measured with
   great accuracy. Two major effects have been identified which are likely
   to account for most of the bias for maximum likelihood methods in
   recent shear measurement challenges. Model bias occurs when the true
   galaxy shape is not well represented by the fitted model. Noise bias
   occurs due to the non-linear relationship between image pixels and
   galaxy shape. In this paper we investigate the potential interplay
   between these two effects when an imperfect model is used in the
   presence of high noise. We present analytical expressions for this
   bias, which depends on the residual difference between the model and
   real data. They can lead to biases not accounted for in previous
   calibration schemes. By measuring the model bias, noise bias and their
   interaction, we provide a complete statistical framework for measuring
   galaxy shapes with model fitting methods from GRavitational lEnsing
   Accuracy Testing (GREAT) like images. We demonstrate the noise and
   model interaction bias using a simple toy model, which indicates that
   this effect can potentially be significant. Using real galaxy images
   from the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) we quantify the
   strength of the model bias, noise bias and their interaction. We find
   that the interaction term is often a similar size to the model bias
   term, and is smaller than the requirements of the current and shortly
   upcoming galaxy surveys.

   Shape measurement biases from underfitting and ellipticity gradients

   pp. 2793-2804. (MNRAS Homepage)
 
   Precision weak gravitational lensing experiments require measurements
   of galaxy shapes accurate to <1 part in 1000. We investigate
   measurement biases, noted by Voigt & Bridle and Melchior et al., that
   are common to shape measurement methodologies that rely upon fitting
   elliptical-isophote galaxy models to observed data. The first bias
   arises when the true galaxy shapes do not match the models being fit.
   We show that this `underfitting bias' is due, at root, to these
   methods' attempts to use information at high spatial frequencies that
   have been destroyed by the convolution with the point spread function
   (PSF) and/or by sampling. We propose a new shape-measurement technique
   that is explicitly confined to observable regions of k-space. A second
   bias arises for galaxies whose ellipticity varies with radius. For most
   shape-measurement methods, such galaxies are subject to `ellipticity
   gradient bias'. We show how to reduce such biases by factors of 20-100
   within the new shape-measurement method. The resulting shear estimator
   has multiplicative errors <1 part in 10^3 for high signal-to-noise
   ratio images, even for highly asymmetric galaxies. Without any training
   or recalibration, the new method obtains Q = 3000 in the GREAT08
   Challenge of blind shear reconstruction on low-noise galaxies, several
   times better than any previous method.

   Title:
   Bayesian Lensing Shear Measurement
   Authors:
   Bernstein, Gary M.; Armstrong, Robert
   Publication:
   eprint arXiv:1304.1843
 
   We derive an estimator of weak gravitational lensing shear from
   background galaxy images that avoids noise-induced biases through a
   rigorous Bayesian treatment of the measurement. The derived shear
   estimator disposes with the assignment of ellipticities to individual
   galaxies that is typical of previous approaches to galaxy lensing.
   Shear estimates from the mean of the Bayesian posterior are unbiased in
   the limit of large number of background galaxies, regardless of the
   noise level on individual galaxies. The Bayesian formalism requires a
   prior describing the (noiseless) distribution of the target galaxy
   population over some parameter space; this prior can be constructed
   from low-noise images of a subsample of the target population,
   attainable from long integrations of a fraction of the survey field. We
   find two ways to combine this exact treatment of noise with rigorous
   treatment of the effects of the instrumental point-spread function and
   sampling. The Bayesian model fitting (BMF) method assigns a likelihood
   of the pixel data to galaxy models (e.g. Sersic ellipses). The Bayesian
   Fourier domain (BFD) method compresses the pixel data to a small set of
   weighted moments calculated after PSF correction in Fourier space. A
   numerical test using a simplified model of a biased galaxy measurement
   process demonstrates that the Bayesian formalism recovers applied
   shears to $<1$ part in $10^3$ accuracy and provides accurate
   uncertainty estimates. BFD is the first shear measurement algorithm
   that is model-free and requires no approximations or ad hoc assumptions
   in correcting for the effects of PSF, noise, or sampling on the galaxy
   images. These algorithms are good candidates for attaining the
   part-per-thousand shear inference required for hemisphere-scale weak
   gravitational lensing surveys. (abridged)
