\begin{abstract}
We demonstrate the Tractor's performace in several different
settings, including galaxy shape and photometry inference.
% We don't go into much detail, simply referring to MBI1.  I think we have lots of other
% content, so there's no need to talk about our Great3 efforts in any depth.
